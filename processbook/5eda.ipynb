    "In order to provide details on the factor effects, we used two approaches. Overall effects were provided by the Sci-kit Learn [Random Forest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) classification, specifically the feature_importance property. In order to extract factors per school, we used Linear Mixed Model analysis using the following R code:\n",

    "It was suggested that we have tooltips to explain these items. Tooltips would work on desktop, but not on mobile which is one of our design goals. We may need to re-examine user input since requiring tooltips means that our design is not sufficiently intuitive.\n",

We expect to do some user testing and address these issues prior to the project deadline. Note that the real visualization allows 3d exploration of the space for panning, zooming and changing camera angle."

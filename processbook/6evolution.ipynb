    "\n",
    "A heuristic evaluation was performed in Studio on April 6, 2016. As of this writing, our team has not received the Heuristic Evaluation Report from Team Chart Junkis, so these redesign notes are based only on our own notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "From the paper prototype, it was unclear what the sliders were for. We suspect that this was mainly due to an artifact of the paper prototype, as previous HTML implementations with user testing did not have this problem. Similarly, the variables such as SAT / ACT were not clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was suggested that we have tooltips to explain these items. Tooltips would work on desktop, but not on mobile which is one of our design goals. We may need to re-examine user input since requiring tooltips means that our design is not sufficiently intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current design has significant changes to the axes as the sliders move. This was deemed unintuitive so we will redesign with more static axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a comparison (design 2) was universally more desirable than not having a comparison (design 1).\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is complete heuristic evaluation we received from Team Chart Junkis on April 11:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task: input personal information and select schools? [Severity 4]** The lines on the visualization imply a progression over time, which is confusing. Additionally, as the number of schools increases, it becomes more difficult to compare schools that are further apart on the screen.  Would it be possible to reorder the schools? More clarity in the axes would make using the visualization more intuitive.\n",
    "1. **Change the stars to one vertical line [Severity 4]** The repetitive symbols are unnecessary, especially if they will all be on the same vertical line on the comparison chart.\n",
    "1. **Add fields for user input [Severity 4]** The forms for personal information only address the fields that are expressed on the current visualization.  Will there be fields to input further information such as demographic, extracurricular activity, or hometown? The format of numerical user input (slider) is good, but it also sets the expectation that the visualization will be live-updating.\n",
    "1. **Consider changing lines to bars [Severity 2**] The team was divided on this element, but proponents of the bar graph believe that it would add clarity to the visualization and be a more effective use of\n",
    "1. **Dashboard prototype is too busy [Severity 3]** The second prototype contained Consider changing many sections visualizing individual aspects of college admissions data. This presents a large amount of information to the user that is difficult to process.  Given the number of visualizations, the user would have to scroll down the page to view them all.  It is unclear if all of the visualizations would be constantly updating to reflect changes in user input. If the user clicks one visualization, will the others disappear? Can they individually update? Else, is this meant to illustrate comparisons? A second draft of the prototype may naturally address some of these issues.\n",
    "1. **Early decision values should be relative [Severity 4]** As a college applicant, it is helpful to know which schools are more likely to accept early decision applicants with information like my own.  This visualization should also compare a school’s baseline acceptance rate to its early rate. It is also unclear if students will have the option to view multiple schools.\n",
    "1. **Change “add scenario” to “save scenario” [Severity 1]** If there is a line on the screen that updates immediately to reflect changes in user input, the user should have an option to save that line. The use of the word “add” suggests a beginning a new task instead of finishing a current one.\n",
    "1. **Allow subcategories for different types of schools [Severity 1]** It would be useful to be able to categorize and save schools into common buckets such as “safety” and “reach” colleges. Breakdowns comparing state schools to other state schools and private universities to other private universities would also be helpful. \n",

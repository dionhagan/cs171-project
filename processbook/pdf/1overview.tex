    \section{Team Braavos - Predicting and Visualizing College
Admissions}\label{team-braavos---predicting-and-visualizing-college-admissions}

    \section{Overview and Motivation}\label{overview-and-motivation}

    Every year, four million students apply to US Colleges without having a
good idea of their chances of getting in. Fueled by US News Rankings,
colleges puff up their rejection rates, while myopically finding
students through the narrow lens of standardized test scores. This
project provides data-science based probabilities of getting in along
with interactive visualizations, allowing students and parents to
investigate how certain aspects of their application affect the chances
of an acceptance to various schools and therefore allowing them to best
focus their time and money. Users can also view summaries of application
and acceptance data to make other inferences about their own potential
success in applying to different colleges. We then aim to disrupt the
entire application process so quality students can be matched to the
right school and schools can fulfill their desired mix of students..

     \#\# Team and Roles

Team Braavos consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Marina Adario
\item
  Dion Hagan
\item
  Malcolm Mason Rodriguez
\item
  David Wihl
\end{itemize}

We anticipate being a fully agile team without pre-defined roles. Anyone
can submit, check-in or work on any story.

The team maintains a \href{https://trello.com/b/zguJ72GM}{Kanban board
via Trello}. The ``To Do'' column is a regularly triaged and sorted list
of the next task. Once an individual completes a task, he or she grabs
the next item off the top of the list.

 \#\#\# Communication Rules:

We collaborate regularly during the week via Slack. Email usage is
minimal as necessary. Electonic signatures will suffice when signatures
are required for submission.

Physical meetings occur once per week on Wednesday either during or just
after Studio as necessary.

 \#\#\# Collaboration Policy

The entire project is
\href{https://github.com/wihl/cs171-project}{version controlled through
github}. Any non-trivial story will have a separate branch, with regular
check-ins and merges. We are attempting to be fully Agile so any member
can work on any story. Each story should be short, no longer than two
days. Stories that are blocked will be indicated as such in Trello via a
red bar label.

     \#\# Feature List

The visualization will consist of at least two pages.

 \#\#\# Page 1 - See Your Chances

This will be the home page of the site. There will be two areas for data
entry:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Area 1 - demographic data that cannot be changed, including gender, US
  citizenship, first to attend college, etc.
\item
  Area 2 - college admission factors that may vary prior to college
  application such as GPA, standardized test scores, number of AP exams
  taken.
\end{itemize}

As the applicant changes values in area 2, the visualization will
update. The intent is this will be highly interactive, almost game-like,
encourgaging the applicant to attempt many different scenarios.

 \#\#\# Page 2 - Data Drill Down

The second page will have several linked visualizations that allow the
user to drill down into the specific factors that weigh into the college
acceptance process. This allows the applicant to compare and contrast
different schools as well as plan time for the most appropriate
activities to maximum college acceptance.

 \#\#\# Summary of Features

    "The majority of the processing is performed in client-side JavaScript. The prediction calculations are currently performed in Python-based webservice hosted on Heroku, as the implementation is using Sci-kit Learn's [RandomForest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) library. Unfortunately, there is significant latency when using the webservice, with delays up t0 10 seconds for a single prediction. This does not meet our current goals of having a very interactive, game-like experience when performing predictions. \n",

## Team Proposal

(DRAFT FOR REVIEW ONLY)

Across the country four million students will be submitting upwards of forty million applications ([source](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/nyregion/applications-by-the-dozen-as-anxious-students-hedge-college-bets.html)) and then fretting until April to find the results. Based on the prior analysis performed by some of the current team members in Data Science Class (CS109),
we are planning to help these students and their parents
in two ways:

1. Build an online predictor that lets a student or parent enter current SAT, GPA and other information to see the chances of getting into an elite college. Even more importantly, the student can then change the values to see if time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity sports. This will be based on D3 and possibly HTML forms with a high degree of interaction, almost to the point of being a game-like
interface.

2. Through several interactive visualizations, allow
an applicant or their parent to understand the
factors that most impact a college's decision, both in
aggregate for all elite colleges as well as
specifically for a given top 25 institution. This will
also be based on D3 and possibly HTML forms.

The site will consist of at least two pages and be responsive so that it works equally
well on mobile phones as well as desktops. The audience
will be high school applicants to elite colleges and
their families.

# Goals and Tasks

## Goals

* Build a highly interactive, responsive visualization of an applicant's
probabilities of acceptance at an elite US College.
* Through several interactive visualizations, allow
an applicant or their parent to understand the
factors that most impact a college's decision, both in
aggregate for all elite colleges as well as
specifically for a given top 25 institution.
